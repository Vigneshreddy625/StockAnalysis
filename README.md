# Stock Analysis with React Vite, React Chart.js, Tailwind CSS, and IEX Cloud API

This project provides a comprehensive stock analysis tool built using React Vite, React Chart.js, Tailwind CSS, and the IEX Cloud API. It leverages data from the IEX Cloud API to display sector performance and individual stock changes over daily, weekly, and monthly periods. Additionally, it showcases sector performance via a pie chart visualization and presents stock changes using line charts. The tool also includes a headline section showing market conditions and the latest news.
